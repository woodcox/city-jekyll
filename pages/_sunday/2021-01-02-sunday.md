**Student Minibus**
Don’t let our location put you off! We run a minibus service for our students who can’t
make it to church another way. 

**Minibus pick up times:** 
* Headingley - opposite Oxfam at 10:10am.
* Leeds University - Outside the Parkinson Building at 10:15am.

## Student Lunches
We’re not sure how this will look this year, however, in a non-COVID world, following our
Sunday morning service our students head for lunch with another family in church to enjoy some good food
and fellowship.

## Student Seminars
Student seminars happen a couple of times a term and are a great opportunity to chat
through what God’s Word has to say on a particular topic – past seminars have covered topics including
devotions, finances, relationships, rest and more.
