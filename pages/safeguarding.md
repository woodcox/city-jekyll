## 1. INTRODUCTION

The City Evangelical Church eldership recognises the importance of its ministry/work with children,  young people and adults in need of protection and its responsibility to protect everyone entrusted to our care. We are committed to creating and enabling a healthy culture in order to minimise any coercion and control within our church.
The scope of this policy covers the adult, child and young people’s activities that are organised and staffed by appointed workers and volunteers of City Evangelical Church only. This policy shall not apply to any activities organised or otherwise facilitated by third parties who may elect to hire the church’s premises. However, it is hoped that all organisations/charities using the church’s premises will have their own Safeguarding Policy in place.  
As an Eldership we recognise that we have a Biblical responsibility to value and teach children and young people entrusted to our care. Our example comes from Jesus Christ, who Himself valued people, spent time with them in teaching and demonstrated care and compassion for all, including children.

> Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven” <cite>Matthew 19 v 13-14</cite>

The eldership of City Evangelical Church is committed to the safeguarding of children, young people and adults and to ensuring their wellbeing. They have much to give as well as to receive.  We will listen to them.  As we nurture them in the gospel and the teaching of Christ, we will respect their wishes and feelings.
 

### Specifically:

-  We recognise that we all have a responsibility to help prevent the physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well as the neglect of children and young people (those under 18 years of age) and to report any such abuse that we discover or suspect.
-  We believe every child and young person should be valued, safe and happy.  We want to make sure that children and young people that we have contact with know this and are empowered to tell us if they are suffering harm.
-  All children and young people have the right to be treated with respect, to be listened to and to be protected from all forms of abuse.
*  We recognise that we all have a responsibility to help prevent the physical, sexual, psychological, financial and discriminatory abuse as well as the neglect of adults, particularly those who have care and support needs and to report any such abuse that we discover or suspect.
*  We undertake to exercise proper care in the appointment and selection of all those who will work with children, young people and adults with care and support needs.
*  We believe in the necessity of creating a healthy culture in our church where the value of all people is recognised and challenges are responded to appropriately.
*  When someone attending the church is known to have abused children, young people or vulnerable adults, measures will be put in place to ensure their protection.


### We are committed to:

*  Recognising the requirements for UK legislation / good practice recommendations in relation to safeguarding children and adults – this will be done through our Safeguarding Policy which represents an appropriate interpretation of the relevant legislation/guidelines in the context of City Evangelical Church.
*  Implementing the requirements of legislation regarding people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that the premises meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 and all other relevant legislation, and that it is welcoming and inclusive.
*  Providing appropriate safeguarding training for its workers and volunteers and having a requirement that they adhere to the agreed principles and procedures within our Safeguarding Policy.
-  Supporting all employees, the Safeguarding Co-ordinators and ministry leaders in their work and in any action they may need to take in order to protect children and vulnerable adults.
-  Supporting parents and their families as well as those who are affected by or perpetrate abuse.
-  Nurturing, protecting and safeguarding children and young people.
-  Supporting, resourcing, training, monitoring and providing supervision to all those who regularly undertake this work.
-  Regularly reviewing the operational guidelines attached.


### We recognise:

-  Leeds Children’s Social Work Service has lead responsibility for investigating all allegations or suspicions of abuse where there are concerns about a child or young person.  Leeds Adult Social Care has lead responsibility for investigating all allegations or suspicions of abuse where there are concerns about an adult with care and support needs.
-  Where an allegation suggests that a criminal offence may have been committed then the Police should be contacted as a matter of urgency.
-  Safeguarding is the responsibility of each person in the church, and any abuse discovered or suspected should be reported to the Safeguarding Co-ordinator in the first instance.

This policy defines the principle and practice by which the Church will work with children, young people and vulnerable adults.  

The implementation of our Safeguarding Policy will be carried out in accordance with defined procedures. These are contained in the ‘Safeguarding Procedures Handbook’ (SPH) a copy of which will be available upon request. The revision of the Safeguarding Policy and related procedures is the responsibility of the eldership and Safeguarding Co-ordinator. Any substantive changes to the Safeguarding Policy and related procedures shall be subject to approval by the eldership; before being reported in a church members’ meeting.
We will review this statement and our policy and procedures every year with the assistance of the Safeguarding Co-ordinator.

## 3. RECOGNISING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ABUSE

It is important that all staff and volunteers understand the different forms of abuse that some children, young people and adults may experience and the signs and symptoms of such abuse. Defining child abuse or abuse against an adult is a difficult and complex issue. A person may abuse by inflicting harm or failing to prevent harm. Children and vulnerable adults may be abused within a family, an institution or a community setting. Very often the abuser is known or in a trusted relationship with the child or adult.
 
There are four categories of abuse which can cause long term damage to a child, young person or adults. These are defined below as well as how to respond to a disclosure of abuse, are included here in our policy.
 
Recognising abuse

**PHYSICAL ABUSE:** Is the deliberate harm of a child or adult and may involve hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating, or otherwise causing physical harm.  Physical harm may also be caused when a parent/carer fabricates the symptoms of, or deliberately induces illness in a child.

**EMOTIONAL ABUSE:** Is the persistent emotional maltreatment of a child, young person or adult such as to cause severe and persistent adverse effects to their emotional development. It may involve conveying that someone is worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only in so far as they meet the needs of another person. It may include not giving someone opportunities to express their views, deliberately silencing them or “making fun” of what they say or how they communicate. It may feature age or developmentally inappropriate expectations being imposed on children.  These may include interactions that are beyond a child, young person or vulnerable adult’s developmental capability, as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning, or preventing them from participating in normal social interaction.  It may involve seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another.  It may involve serious bullying, (including cyber- bullying) causing a child, young person or vulnerable adult to frequently feel frightened or in danger, or to be exploited or corrupted.  Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment, though it may occur alone.

**SEXUAL ABUSE:**  Involves forcing or enticing a child, young person or vulnerable adult to take part in sexual activities, not necessarily involving a high level of violence, whether or not they are  aware of what is happening. The activities may involve physical contact, including assault by penetration (for example, rape or oral sex) or non- penetrative acts such as masturbation, kissing, rubbing and touching outside of clothing  They may include non-contact activities, such as involving children, young people or vulnerable adults in looking at, or in the production of, sexual online images, watching sexual activities, or encouraging them to behave in sexually inappropriate ways, or grooming them in preparation for abuse (including via the internet). Sexual abuse is not solely perpetrated by adult males. Women can also commit acts of sexual abuse, as can other children and young people.

**NEGLECT:** Is the persistent failure to meet a child, young person or vulnerable adult’s basic physical and or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of their health or development.  Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance abuse. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child, young person or vulnerable adult’s basic emotional needs.

 
Possible signs of abuse include (but not limited to):

-  Unexplained or suspicious injuries such as bruising cuts or burns, particularly if situated on a part of the body not normally prone to such injuries or the explanation of the cause of the injury is does not seem right.
-  The child/young person or adult discloses abuse, or describes what appears to be an abusive act.
-  Someone else (child or adult) expresses concern about the welfare of another child, young person or vulnerable adult.
-  Unexplained change in behaviour such as withdrawal or sudden outbursts of temper.
-  Inappropriate sexual awareness or sexually explicit behaviour.
-  Distrust of adults, particularly those with whom a close relationship would normally be expected.
-  Difficulty in making friends.
-  Eating disorders, depression, self harm or suicide attempts.
 
**DOMESTIC ABUSE:** Anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexuality or background. The cross-Government definition of domestic violence and abuse is any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality. This can encompass, but is not limited to psychological, physical, sexual, financial and emotional abuse. While this definition applies to those aged 16 or above, adult to parent violence and abuse can equally involve children under 16.

 
## 4. BECOMING AWARE OF A SAFEGUARDING ISSUE

If a worker or volunteer becomes aware of a safeguarding issue, under no circumstances should they carry out their own investigation into an allegation or suspicion of abuse.  The following procedures should be applied:
{% for sl_details in site.data.contact.safeguard_lead %}
-  The person in receipt of allegations or suspicions of abuse should report concerns as soon as possible to {{ sl_details.name }} (hereafter the "Safeguarding Co-ordinator") telephone number {{ sl_details.phone }} and followed up in writing on a ‘Cause for concern form’ (annexed to this policy and available in each Ministry Room and the main auditorium).{% endfor %}{% for dsl_info in site.data.contact.deputy_safeguard %}
-  In the absence of the Safeguarding Co-ordinator or, if the suspicions in any way involve the Safeguarding Co-ordinator, then the report should be made to {{ dsl_info.name }} (hereafter the "Deputy Safeguarding Co-ordinator") telephone {{ dsl_info.phone }}{% endfor %}.  If the suspicions implicate both the Safeguarding Co-ordinator and the Deputy, then the report should be made in the first instance to {% for pastor_info in site.data.contact.pastor %}{{ pastor_info.name }} (telephone number {{ pastor_info.phone }}{% endfor %}) or Thirtyone:eight. Alternatively contact Leeds Children’s Social Work Service or the Police.
-  Where the concern is about a child the Safeguarding Co-ordinator should contact Children’s Social Services.  Where the concern is regarding an adult in need of protection contact Adult Social Services or take advice from Thirtyone:eight (as above).
 

## 5. WHAT TO DO IF A CHILD, YOUNG PERSON OR VULNERABLE ADULT MAKES A DISCLOSURE / ALLEGATION
 
It is important that you treat any allegations extremely seriously. Never think that someone else may be dealing with it. If you receive information that a child may be at risk of, or experiencing harm the following steps should be taken:  

### Stage 1
-  Keep calm and try to maintain a neutral expression
-  Initially talk to the child/young person/vulnerable adult about what you are observing. It is okay to ask questions, for example: “I’ve noticed that you don’t appear yourself today, is everything okay? Ask questions such as ‘tell me’, ‘explain’ or ‘describe’ when seeking clarity. But never use leading questions, for example: “are you upset because someone has hurt you”.
-  Listen carefully to what the child/young person/vulnerable adult has to say and take it seriously. Reassure them that you believe what they are saying.
-  Be honest and tell the child/young person/vulnerable adult that you will need to let someone else know – do not promise confidentiality.
-  It is not the responsibility of groups to investigate incidences of suspected abuse but to gather information and refer only.
-  Notify the Safeguarding Co-ordinator or Deputy Safeguarding Co-ordinator immediately (page 4).
-  Record what was said as soon as possible after any disclosure; the person who receives the allegation or has the concern, should complete a Cause for Concern form and ensure it is signed and dated.  
 
### Stage 2
-  The Safeguarding Co-ordinator should take immediate action if there is a suspicion that a child/young person/vulnerable adult has been abused or are likely to be abused.  In this situation the Safeguarding Co-ordinator should contact the Police and/or the Leeds Children’s Social Work Duty and Advice Team. If a referral is made direct to the Duty and Advice team this should be followed up in writing within 24 hrs.
- Parents/carers will need to be informed about any referral to Children and Young people’s Social Care unless to do so would place the child/young person/vulnerable adult at an increased risk of harm. If there is uncertainty about whether to notify a parent/carer about a referral the timing should decided in discussion with Social Services and or the Police.
- Full documentation of the investigation and of the outcome is to be kept securely, and treated as confidential by the elders.
- The Safeguarding Co-ordinator will seek the consent of the child, young person and or their parent to provide feedback to the person raising the concern. If consent is not provided, the referrer will as a minimum be reassured that their concerns have been dealt with appropriately.
 
Where there is a concern that an adult is in need of protection:
(Suspicions or allegations of abuse or harm including; physical, sexual, organisational, financial, discriminatory, neglect, self-neglect, forced marriage, modern slavery, domestic abuse)
 
If there is concern about any of the above, the Safeguarding Co-ordinator/Deputy will:
- Speak to the adult that the concern relates to, unless doing so would please them at increased risk of harm.
- Consider contacting Adult Social Services or take advice from Thirtyone:eight as above (see page 4)
- If the adult is in immediate danger or has sustained a serious injury contact the Emergency Services, informing them of any suspicions.
- If there is a concern about domestic abuse and there are children within the family, Children’s Social Work Services will also be contacted.
- In an emergency, consider calling 101 for advice or the Police on 999 (this number should only be used if the person is believed to be in imminent danger).
- The Safeguarding Co-ordinator may need to inform others depending on the circumstances and/or nature of the concern. Suspicions must not be discussed with anyone other than those nominated above. A written record of the concerns should be made as soon as possible on a Cause for Concern form and should not include your unjustified opinion in accordance with these procedures and should be kept in a secure place.
If there is a concern regarding emotional abuse, the Safeguarding Co-ordinator will:

- Identify support services for the victim i.e. counselling or other pastoral support (this will be in consultation with an elder).
- Contact Thirtyone:eight and in discussion with them will consider appropriate action with regards to the scale of the concern.
Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility
- Whilst allegations or suspicions of abuse will normally be reported to the Safeguarding Co-ordinator, the absence of the Safeguarding Co-ordinator or Deputy should not delay referral to Social Services, the Police or taking advice from Thirtyone:eight.
- The Eldership will support the Safeguarding Co-ordinator/Deputy in their role, and accept that any information they may have in their possession will be shared in a strictly limited way on a need to know basis.
- It is, of course, the right of any individual as a citizen to make a direct referral to the safeguarding agencies or seek advice from Thirtyone:eight, although the Eldership hope that members of the church will use this procedure. If, however, the individual with the concern feels that the Safeguarding Co-ordinator/Deputy has not responded appropriately, or where they have a disagreement with the Safeguarding Co-ordinators as to the appropriateness of a referral they are free to contact an outside agency directly.  We hope by making this statement that the Eldership demonstrate its commitment to effective safeguarding and the protection of all those who are vulnerable.
 

## 6. SAFER RECRUITMENT

Safer recruitment procedures (for those involved in children/youth work or work with vulnerable adults) will ensure that:
- There is a written job/role description for the post.
- There is a formal application form.
- References are sought where necessary.
- Those involved in a significant role have completed a self-declaration form.
- Safeguarding has been discussed with employees/volunteers, the Safeguarding Policy has been shared and the applicant confirms in writing that they have read it.
- An enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check (DBS) has been completed for relevant roles and the results are satisfactory (we will comply with Code of Practice requirements concerning the fair treatment of applicants and the handling of information).
- A suitable safeguarding training programme will be provided.
 
(It is anticipated that the majority of volunteers will be formal church members.  However, where the employee/volunteer is not a formal member or has been a member for less than 3 years, a written reference will be requested and followed up where appropriate. For formal church members, confirmation will be requested from 2 elders that they are suitable to serve.)
The Safeguarding Co-Ordinator will maintain an up to date list of the volunteers and the training that they have received.  
 

## 7. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION OF STAFF / VOLUNTEERS

The purpose of supervision is to:
 
- Ensure that performance and practice, including safeguarding, is competent and accountable.
- Provide reflective space to analyse work with children, young people and vulnerable adults as well as specific incidents, assessing risk and need. It also provides an important check and balance on decision making and planning.
- Support volunteer’s development needs, including safeguarding practice.
- Provide reflective space for the staff and volunteers to discuss and work through the personal impact of their role and responsibilities. This should include support to address the emotional impact of the work where required.
- Each Ministry Leader will determine the frequency of supervision and whether it will be group supervision as ministry teams or one to one.
Following any incidents of concern, Ministry Leaders should aim to hold a debrief at the end of the session to consider actions going forward. The Safeguarding Co-ordinator should be updated of any concerns as soon as possible.


## 8. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF

If an allegation is made against a worker (whether a volunteer or paid member of staff), the person receiving the referral must ensure that that the child or adult is safe and away from the person against whom the allegation is made.

The allegation should be discussed with the Safeguarding Co-ordinator who will discuss this with the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) and make a written referral within one working day of the allegation being made. The referral form is found on the Leeds Local Safeguarding Children Partnership (LSCP) website or the LADO can be contact on 0113 37 89687. Children’s Social Services should also be contacted if the person has children or spends any unsupervised time with children.

If the allegation is about the Safeguarding Co-ordinator or the Deputy Safeguarding Co-ordinator or Michael Luehrmann. The matter should then be discussed with the LADO.

Regardless of whether a Police and/or a Children Social Work Service investigation follows, an internal investigation (the timing of which will be considered on a case by case basis) should take place and consideration should be given to the operation of disciplinary procedures. This may involve an immediate suspension and/or ultimate dismissal dependant on the nature of the incident.


## 9. RECORDING AND MANAGING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

- The elders are committed to managing confidential information safely in accordance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Confidential information will be stored securely in a locked storage box or cabinet.
- The elders recognise that children, young people and vulnerable adults have a right to confidentiality and will seek to abide by this wherever possible. In the first instance, consent will be sought from the person who the information pertains to and their parents. However, if it is considered that the process of seeking consent will place a child, young person or adult at risk of significant harm consent will not be sought.
- In the event that there is uncertainty about whether consent is necessary, Thirtyone:eight or Social Services (Children or Adults) should be contacted and the case should be anonymously discussed. Social Services will advise as to whether consent is needed.
- Consideration will always be given to whether sharing information is necessary, proportionate, relevant, accurate, timely and secure. You should ensure that any information shared is necessary for the purpose for which you are sharing it, is shared only with those people who need to have it, is accurate and up-to-date, is shared in a timely fashion, and is shared securely.
 

## 10. DISTRIBUTING / REVIEWING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

- An electronic copy will be provided to all members and will be available on City Evangelical Church’s website.
- A notice will be placed on the Children and Youth work noticeboard advising that a paper copy of the Safeguarding Policy will be provided to each ministry team and a copy will be available in the main auditorium.
 
 
## 11. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ELDERS AND MINISTRY LEADERS

### Good Practice Guidelines
 
As a church working with children, young people and vulnerable adults we wish to operate and promote good working practice. This will enable workers to run activities safely, develop good relationships and minimise the risk of false or unfounded allegations.
 
Organisation leaders can reduce likely situations for abuse of children, young people and vulnerable adults and help protect workers from false allegations by making sure that all existing and new workers are aware that, as a general rule workers should use their best endeavours to abide by the following principles:
- Avoid spending time alone with children, young people and vulnerable adults (of the opposite gender).
- If meeting one to one always try to meet in a public place ensuring that the young person’s parents know where they are, what time they are meeting and rough time that they will return home.
- Never meet in a child/young person’s bedroom. If you have to meet in a child or young person’s home, ensure that there is always an adult present and you are in a communal area.
- Do not take children/young people alone in a car on journeys. In exceptional cases, a parent can sign a consent form for their child to be transported by an adult. This must be in consultation with the Safeguarding Co-Ordinator.  
Where occasions arise when it is unavoidable that these things do happen, they should only occur with the full knowledge and consent of the organisation/group leader and the child/young person’s parent/carer if possible. If prior consent has not been agreed, a Cause for Concern form should be completed.
All existing and new workers must clearly understand that they should.....
- Avoid engaging in rough, physical play and never engage in sexually provocative games and horseplay with anyone;
- Never allow or engage in inappropriate touching of any form;
- Never allow children or young people to use inappropriate language unchallenged;
- Never make sexually suggestive comments about or to a child or young person, even in fun;
- Never promise secrecy - whatever a child or young person tells us, if it concerns abuse, we must pass it on and tell the child or young person why;
- Never leave a meeting unattended, irrespective of the number of children present - children will be safer if supervised by two or more adults (unless exceptional circumstances render this absolutely necessary), in which case leave the door open and notify any nearby adults that another adult is alone with a group. If this occurs, consideration should be given to a Cause for Concern form being completed and given to the Safeguarding Co-ordinator if a significant incident has occurred.
- Never let any allegation made by a child, young person or worker go unreported to the Safeguarding Co-Ordinator. DO NOT to try to investigate or deal with an allegation (see below);
- Never engage in scapegoating, ridiculing or rejecting a child or young person;
- Do not accept friend requests or follow children on social media. Discourage young people from directly messaging you. Wherever possible use the official social media accounts to communicate (those which more than one adult have access to).
- Avoid doing anything of a personal nature for children/vulnerable adults that they can do for themselves*.
- It may sometimes be necessary for workers to do things of a personal nature for children, particularly if they are very young or have disabilities.  These tasks should only be carried out with the full understanding and consent of parents. In an emergency situation which requires this type of help, parents/carers should be fully informed.  In such situations, it is important that all workers are sensitive to the child and undertake personal care tasks with the utmost discretion.  Where possible, two workers should be present.
 
### Guidelines for behaviour management
- Ask God for wisdom, discernment and understanding and pray for the child
- Work on each individual child’s positives, do not compare them with each other, but encourage and build them up, giving them responsibility for simple tasks.
- Build healthy relationships with children/young people and be a good role model, setting a good example. You cannot expect children/young people to observe ground rules if you break them yourself.
- Take care to give quieter and well behaved children/young people your attention and do not allow some children/young people to take all your time and energy.
- Be consistent in what you say and ensure that other team members know what you have said – this avoids manipulation.
- Never smack or hit a child/young person and only use physical constraint if the child/young person is a danger to themselves or others using only reasonable force to ensure their safety and the safety of others (if this occurs a Cause for Concern form should be completed)
- Don’t shout – change voice tone as necessary.
- Discipline out of love never anger. (Call on support from other leaders if you feel you may deal with the situation unwisely in your anger.)
- Lay down ground rules e.g. no swearing, racism, and name-calling and always challenge inappropriate language. A respect for property, and make sure the child understands the action that will be taken.
- Separate children/young people who have a tendency to be disruptive together. Give them a chance and only separate if they are disruptive.
- Have leaders sit with the children/young people.
- Be proactive and don’t wait to be told to deal with a situation.
- Take the child/young person aside and talk to them, challenge them to change, whilst encouraging them on their strengths.
- Warn a child/young person that you will speak to their parents/carer. As a last resort ban them for a week and advise the parents/carer of the decision.
- Never lock a child/young person in a room.
- If behaviour is extremely dangerous and places anyone at immediate risk of harm, call the Police.
 
### Supporting those affected by abuse
The Eldership is committed to offering pastoral care, working with statutory agencies as appropriate, and support to all those who have been affected by abuse who have contact with or are part of the church fellowship.
The level of support offered will be determined by the pastoral team based on specific circumstances.
 
### Working with offenders
When someone attending the church is known to have abused children/young people, or is known to be a risk to vulnerable adults the Eldership will supervise the individual concerned and offer pastoral care, but in its safeguarding commitment to the protection of children/young people and vulnerable adults, set boundaries for that person, which they will be expected to keep.
 
On a case by case basis, a formal contract may be drafted that gives details of both the boundaries that the individual is expected to keep and the support that will be offered.  This contract would be tailored specifically to individual circumstances and informed ideally by risk assessments from statutory agencies.
